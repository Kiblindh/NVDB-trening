## Description
The file shows a simple example of function calling. I wrote these scripts to learn function calling and the use of the OpenAI api. The apikey in the commit history has been deleted so that it's not a security flaw. 
The scripts demonstrate a basic use of a chatbot where you can ask questions related to information of some certain endpoints in nvdb (nasjonal vegdatabank) 
which is Statens Vegvesens database containing traffic information
